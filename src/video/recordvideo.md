## Recording a video on iOS devices

Some iOS users may have problems taking and uploading their short video. If the camera does not open or shows a black screen when taking a video, this may be a problem with permissions or a known bug in the operating system.

Users should make sure the Safari browser on their device has camera and microphone permissions. Updating the iOS operating system software on their device to a newer version may also help, if available. Version 11.2 will always show a black screen when trying to open the camera. There is an [Apple support article](https://support.apple.com/en-gb "Apple support article") that describes how to check for updates.

## Recording a video on Android devices

Some Android users may have problems recording and uploading their short video. To try to fix this problem users should avoid the ‘camera’ option when given a choice of applications to record the video with. They should choose a video option instead, like ‘camcorder’ or ‘capture video’.

Users should also make sure the web browser on their device has camera and microphone permissions. The user’s device also needs enough free memory to record and save the video.

## Unsupported video format

Some devices automatically record a video in an unsupported video format. We are testing ways to support additional video formats. In the meantime, users can change the video format of the device to a supported format.

For example:
* video/mp4
* video/webm

Alternatively, users can try register again on a different device. For example, a different phone or tablet, or a computer with a webcam. If users complete the process on another browser or device, they can then use the same account to log in on their original device without needing to take the photo or video again.
