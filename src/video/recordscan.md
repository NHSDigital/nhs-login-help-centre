When the scan starts you will see an outline of your face, and an oval. Make sure your face is inside the oval. Then simply follow the instructions given on the screen. For example, the instructions may ask you to move closer to your camera.

Our automated face scan feature uses screens that will flash and change colour. If you have a photosensitive condition and you do not want to do the scan, you can send a short video instead.
