We run a virus check on your uploaded video file before it is verified. If the file you upload is infected or damaged, you can try and upload another one. 

If this keeps happening, there might be a problem with your device. You can try recording a video using a different device and upload it from there. For example, you could borrow a family memberâ€™s device to record and upload a video instead. Once verified, you can then use NHS login on your usual device as normal.
