When you have recorded your video, simply press the ‘play video’ button to watch it back. 

## Unable to replay the video

Some users are unable to replay their short video because a white box is displayed instead of a play button. Also, some device and browser combinations prevent users from proceeding once they have recorded a video. 

This is likely due to the video format captured by the device camera not being supported by the browser for playback. We are testing ways to support additional video formats. In the meantime, users can change the video format of the device to a supported format.

For example:
* video/mp4
* video/webm

You should also avoid using Windows Media Player to replay your video.
