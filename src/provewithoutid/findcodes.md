If you are registered for your GP surgery’s online services, you can use your registration details to prove who you are. If you do not know or remember your registration details, you can ask your GP to give you them.

The 3 details you need are:
* Linkage Key (could be called Passphrase)
* O.D.S. Code (could be called Organisation Code or Practice I.D.)
* Account I.D.

If you are not registered for your GP surgery’s online services, tell your GP surgery that you want to register, and they will ask you to fill in a form. Your surgery will then give you the 3 registration details.
