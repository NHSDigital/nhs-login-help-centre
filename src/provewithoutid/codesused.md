If you see error code reference CID7004, this means your details have already been used to prove who you are on a different NHS login.

This can happen if you are trying to set up a new NHS login with a different email address. You can use the 3 registration details from your GP surgeryâ€™s online services just once to prove who you are on one NHS login only. Once you have used them to prove who you are, you cannot use them again on a different NHS login using a different email address. 

If you want to change the email address on your NHS login you can do so in your account settings. 

If you think that someone else may have used your 3 registration details to set up an NHS login, you should contact the National Service Desk for help.
