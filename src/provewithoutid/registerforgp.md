We run a virus check on the photo of your I.D. before it is verified. If the file you upload is infected or damaged, you can try and upload another one. 

If this keeps happening, there might be a problem with your device. You can try taking a photo using a different device and upload it from there. For example, you could borrow a family member’s device to take and upload a photo instead. Once verified, you can then use NHS login on your usual device as normal.

You can also prove who you are without using photo I.D. by using the registration details from your GP surgery’s online services.

If you do not know or remember your registration details, you can ask your GP to give you them.

The 3 details you need are:
* Linkage Key (could be called Passphrase)
* O.D.S. Code (could be called Organisation Code or Practice I.D.)
* Account I.D.

If you are not registered for your GP surgery’s online services, tell your GP surgery that you want to register, and they will ask you to fill in a form. Your surgery will then give you the 3 registration details.
