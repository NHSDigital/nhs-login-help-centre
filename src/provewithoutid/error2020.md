If you see error reference code CID2020 this means the registration details from your GP surgeryâ€™s online services are invalid and cannot be used to prove who you are.

This could be because:
* you have changed GP surgery
* your GP surgery has changed systems
* your GP surgery has revoked your credentials for their online services 

You can ask your GP for new registration details for their online services. You can use these new details to try to prove who you are.
