The registration details from your GP surgeryâ€™s online services can be used to prove who you are. These include a Linkage Key, an O.D.S. Code and an Account I.D. 

If you enter all 3 registration details correctly, your information will be checked immediately. If approved, you will be able to access your chosen website or app straight away.
