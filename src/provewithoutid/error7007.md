If you see error reference code CID7007, this is caused by a fault with the way your patient record has been set up by your GP surgery. This error can occur when you move to a new GP surgery.

Contact your GP and ask them to make sure your record is marked as 'Active'. 

To do this, your GP surgery needs to follow these instructions:
1. Go to Workflow Manager
2. Select Registration
3. Select FP22 Reminders
4. Select the patient from the list
5. Select Actions from the top ribbon
6. Select Manage Medical Record Flagged Patients
7. Select the patient from the list
8. Select Remove

Then your GP needs to re-register you as a patient by going into ‘Registration’ and selecting ‘Re-Register’ from the top ribbon.

Once this is done you should be able to start again and use the registration details from your GP surgery’s online services to prove who you are
