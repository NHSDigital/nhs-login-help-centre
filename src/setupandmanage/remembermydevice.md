When you log in and enter your six-digit security code, you have the option to select ‘remember this device and stop sending security codes’. If you select this, you won’t need to enter a security code each time you log in with the same device in the future.

To keep your NHS login secure, you should only do this on your own personal or trusted devices. We may ask if you still want us to remember devices in the future.
