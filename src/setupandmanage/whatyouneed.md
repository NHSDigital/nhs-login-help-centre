You will be asked to:

- give your email address
- choose a password
- accept the NHS login terms and conditions

You will then receive an email containing a link. Select this link to confirm your email address. Then return to the website or app you want to access and enter your NHS login email address and password. Here, you will be asked to give your mobile phone number.

A six-digit security code will be sent by text message to your mobile phone. You will be asked to enter this code to continue. A security code will be needed to log in every time, unless you select the ‘remember this device and stop sending security codes’ feature.

There is currently no option to use this service if you do not own a mobile phone.
