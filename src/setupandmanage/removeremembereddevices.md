You can remove any of your remembered devices by visiting your NHS login settings. Under the heading ‘remembered devices’ select ‘remove device’ next to the device you wish to remove from your NHS login.

If you remove a device from your list of remembered devices, it means you will need to enter a security code we send to your phone any time you use NHS login on that device.
