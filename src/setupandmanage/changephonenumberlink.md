To confirm changing your phone number on NHS login, you must follow the confirmation link we email you. If the link does not work, there are a number of possible reasons why.

## Expired link
The link to confirm changing your phone number has a time limit of 24 hours. If it has been more than 24 hours since you received the link in your email, it will no longer work.

You will need to try change your phone number again. We will then send you a new confirmation link in your email.

Call the National Service Desk if you did not mean to change your phone number or you think this is a mistake.

## Used link
The link to confirm changing your phone number may not work because you have already used it and have successfully confirmed your change of phone number. You can change your phone number again by visiting your NHS login settings page.

Call the National Service Desk if you did not mean to change your phone number, or you do not have access to the new phone number.
