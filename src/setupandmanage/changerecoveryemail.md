A recovery email address is a second email address that you own, which will help to secure your NHS login. It will allow you to get back into your account if you cannot log in. We can also use your recovery email to contact you if there is suspicious activity on your NHS login.

You can change your recovery email address by visiting your NHS login settings. Scroll down to the heading ‘recovery methods’ and select ‘change email’.

You will be asked to enter your new recovery email address and your password. A confirmation email will be sent to your new recovery email address. Select the confirmation link in the email to finish.
