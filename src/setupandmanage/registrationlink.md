You need to confirm your email address when setting up an NHS login. To do this, you must follow the registration confirmation link we email you. If the registration confirmation link in your email does not work, there are a number of possible reasons why.

## Malformed link
A malformed link can happen if:

- you copy or type the link from the email and make a mistake
- a technical error occurs
- If this happens, you can try visiting the link in your email again. If you type the web address, check it is correct. If you paste the web address, make sure you copy the full address.

## Expired link
The registration confirmation link we email to you has a time limit of 24 hours. If it has been more than 24 hours since you received the email, the registration confirmation link will no longer work.

You will need to start again and re-enter your email address to receive another registration confirmation link and set up your NHS login.

## Used link
The registration confirmation link may not work because you have already used it and have successfully confirmed your email address.

Try using your NHS login to log in to a website or app.
