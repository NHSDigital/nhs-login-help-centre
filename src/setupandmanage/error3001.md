If you see error reference code CID3001, this is because you no longer have the phone number used to set up your NHS login. This means you need to change the phone number on your NHS login to your new phone number, if you have one.

You can do this if you have a recovery email address set up on your NHS login, or by telling us your NHS number.

If you do not have a recovery email address and you do not know your NHS number, the only way you can change your phone number is by calling the National Service Desk.

Phone: 0300 303 5035

Include the error reference code in your email or phone call: **CID3001**
