## Reference CID7023: Unable to connect to your GP surgery’s system

If reference CID7023 is shown, this means the website or app you are trying to visit needs to connect to your GP surgery’s system and we have not been able to make that connection. If this happens to you, there are a number of possible reasons why.

### You have already set up an NHS login

The details we use to make the connection have already been used to connect you to the website or app you were trying to visit.

This can happen if you already have an NHS login with a different email address. We may have connected that NHS login to your GP surgery’s system. We can only connect one NHS login to your GP surgery’s system.

If you want to change the email address on your NHS login you can do so in your [NHS login settings](https://settings.login.nhs.uk/ 'NHS login settings').

### The details we use are invalid

The details we use to make the connection are invalid.

This can happen if:

- you have changed GP surgery
- your GP surgery has changed systems
- you no longer have permission to use your GP surgery’s online services

If your GP surgery is in England, you can ask your GP for new registration details for their online services.

[Contact us](/contact?error=CID7023 'Contact us') if you need help or if you still have problems.
