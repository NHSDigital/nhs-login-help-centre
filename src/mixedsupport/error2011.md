Every time you log in to a website or app using your NHS login, your NHS number and date of birth are used to find a match in our records. This allows us to connect you to your information securely.

If you see the error reference code CID2011, this can mean we have found multiple matches for your details or your NHS number is no longer in use.

Contact the National Service Desk so we can try to fix the problem.
