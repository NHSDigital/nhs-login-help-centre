title: What does error reference CID7024 mean?

If you see the error reference code CID7024, this means the website or app you are trying to visit needs to connect to your GP surgery’s GP system and we have not been able to make that connection.

This is because we are having some technical problems. Please try again later, or you could try another way to connect by asking your GP surgery for your registration details to their GP online services.

You will need:
* Linkage Key (sometimes called passphrase)
* O.D.S. code (sometimes called organisation code or practice I.D.)
* Account I.D.

Once you have these details, log into the website or app you were trying to access again. If you see the same error message again with reference code CID7024, select the option ‘if you keep getting this message’.

Then select ‘Enter your registration details’.
