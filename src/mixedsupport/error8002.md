If you see the error reference code CID8002, this is because there was a technical problem when you tried to upload a photo of your I.D.

This means your photo file failed to upload and you should try again. If this keeps happening, there might be a problem with your internet connection or device.

You can try uploading a photo using a different device or on a different internet connection. For example, you could borrow a family member’s device to take and upload a photo instead. Once you have proven who you are, you can then use NHS login on your usual device as normal.

You can also prove who you are without using photo I.D. by using the registration details from your GP surgery’s online services.
If you do not know or remember your registration details, you can ask your GP to give you them.

The 3 details you need are:
* Linkage Key (sometimes called passphrase)
* O.D.S. code (sometimes called organisation code or practice I.D.)
* Account I.D.

If you are not registered for your GP surgery’s online services, tell your GP surgery that you want to register, and they will ask you to fill in a form. Your surgery will then give you the 3 registration details.
