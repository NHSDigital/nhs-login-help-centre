Every time you log in to a website or app using your NHS login, your NHS number and date of birth are used to find a match in our records. This allows us to connect you to your information securely.

If you see the error reference code CID2012, this can mean you have been incorrectly marked as dead or someone else is using your information. If this happens to you, your NHS login will be disabled.

Contact the National Service Desk so we can try to fix the problem.
