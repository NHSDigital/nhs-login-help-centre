If you see the error reference code CID7023, this means the website or app you are trying to visit needs to connect to your GP surgery’s GP system and we have not been able to make that connection.

This is because your details have already been used on a different NHS login to make a connection between your GP’s system and the website or app you are trying to visit.

This can happen if you set up a new NHS login with a different email address and try to access a website or app you have used before with a previous NHS login.

Your details can be used only once to connect a website or app to your GP’s system, using only one NHS login. Once they have been used to make a connection, they cannot be used again on a different NHS login using a different email address. 

If you want to change the email address on your NHS login you can do so in your account settings. 

If you think that someone else may have used your details, you should contact the National Service Desk for help.
