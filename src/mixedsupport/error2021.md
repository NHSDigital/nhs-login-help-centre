If you see error reference code CID7021, this means the website or app you are trying to visit needs to connect to your GP surgery’s GP system and we have not been able to make that connection.

This might be because you do not have permission from your GP to use your GP surgery’s online services.

You should speak to your GP surgery about using their online services.
