If you see the error reference code CID7020, this means the website or app you are trying to visit needs to connect to your GP surgery’s GP system and we have not been able to make that connection.

There could be a problem with your details, or with your GP surgery's system.

To connect to your GP surgery’s system, you can ask your GP surgery for your registration details to their GP online services.

You will need:
* Linkage Key (sometimes called passphrase)
* O.D.S. code (sometimes called organisation code or practice I.D.)
* Account I.D.

Once you have these details, log into the website or app you were trying to access again. You will see the same error message with reference code CID7020. It will ask you to try another way to connect your NHS login to your GP surgery. Select this and then select ‘Enter your registration details’.
