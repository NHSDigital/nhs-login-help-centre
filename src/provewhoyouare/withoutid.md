## How to prove who you are without photo ID

You can prove who you are without sending photo <span aria-label="I.D.">ID</span> if your GP is in England. If you are registered for your GP surgery's online services, you will have been given 3 registration details.

The 3 registration details are:

- Linkage Key (could be called Passphrase)
- O.D.S. Code (could be called Organisation Code or Practice I.D.)
- Account I.D.

You can use these 3 registration details to prove who you are instead of using photo <span aria-label="I.D.">ID</span>.

This is not the same as the username and password you use to log into your GP surgery’s online services.

## What to do if your registration details from your GP surgery’s online services do not work

Your registration details from your GP surgery’s online services can be used to prove who you are if your GP is in England.

If this does not work for you, there are a number of possible reasons why.

### Reference CID7001: Wrong details

Reference CID7001 is shown when 1 or more of the details you enter are wrong. This could be because you have wrongly entered 1 or more of your 3 registration details from your GP surgery’s online services. Or, it could mean the name and date of birth you entered does not match what is on your NHS record.

You can try again, making sure you enter the correct details.

If this keeps on happening, contact your GP surgery to check you have the right registration details. If you have the right details, ask your GP surgery to check your name and date of birth is correct and up to date on your NHS record.

### Reference CID7002: You need permission to use your GP surgery’s online services

Speak to your GP as you may need permission to access your GP surgery’s online services.

If you are trying to prove who you are, you can do this using photo I.D. instead. You will not need the registration details from your GP surgery’s online services to do this.

If you are trying to use the NHS App you should speak to your GP surgery about using their online services.

### Reference CID7003: We cannot find you on our system

Reference CID7003 is shown when we cannot find a match on our system for the details you entered. This could mean that you have wrongly entered the registration details from your GP surgery’s online services. Or, it could mean the name and date of birth you entered does not match what is on your NHS record.

If your GP surgery is in England contact them to check you have the right registration details. If you have the right details, ask your GP surgery to check your name and date of birth is correct and up to date on your NHS record.

### Reference CID7006: We cannot find your GP surgery

Reference CID7006 is shown when we cannot find a GP system using the O.D.S. code your entered. This can happen if you change GP surgery. It can also happen if your GP leaves or joins a GP surgery group.

If your GP surgery is in England contact them to check you have the right registration details, making sure you have the correct O.D.S. code.

## What to do if your registration details from your GP surgery’s online services have already been used

Reference CID7004 is shown when the registration details from your GP surgery’s online services have already been used to set up an NHS login. This can happen if you are trying to set up a new NHS login with a different email address.

You can use the 3 registration details from your GP surgery’s online services only once to set up an NHS login. Once you have used them once, you cannot use them again on a different NHS login using a different email address.

If you want to change the email address on your NHS login you can do so by going to your [NHS login settings](https://settings.login.nhs.uk/ 'NHS login settings').

If you think this is a mistake and you have not used your 3 registration details to set up an NHS login, you should [contact us](/contact?error=CID7004 'contact us') for help.

You will need to tell us the email address you use for your NHS login.

## Reference CID2020: Unable to connect to your GP surgery’s online services

This could be because:

- you have changed GP surgery
- your GP surgery has changed systems
- you do not have permission to use your GP surgery’s online services

You can ask your GP for new registration details for their online services if your GP is in England. You can use these new details to try to prove who you are.
