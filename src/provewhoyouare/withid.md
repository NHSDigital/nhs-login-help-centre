## What you need to prove who you are

You will be asked to:

1. take a photo of your ID
2. record your face using your device
3. enter your NHS number if you know it

We ask you to record your face so that we can compare it to your photo ID and prove who you are. We may also ask you for more details to help find your NHS record, like your date of birth or postcode.

## Black screen shows when trying to take a photo

If the camera does not open or shows a black screen when taking a photo, this may be a problem with permissions or a known bug in the operating system.

You should make sure the web browser on your device has camera and microphone permissions. You must also give permission for the NHS login website to access your device’s camera and microphone.

If you are using an iOS device, updating the iOS operating system software on your device to a newer version may also help. Version 11.2 will always show a black screen when trying to open the camera.

There is an [Apple support article](https://support.apple.com/en-gb 'Apple support article') that describes how to check for updates.

## Camera unavailable when trying to take a photo

If your gallery or file manager opens instead of your camera when trying to take a photo, you may have an issue with permissions.

You must give permission for your web browser to access the camera and microphone. If your web browser does not have permission, you will not be given the option to use the camera. Instead, your device's photo gallery or file manager app will open instead.

You must also give permission for the NHS login website to access your device’s camera and microphone.

If this problem keeps happening even with permissions allowed, there might be a problem with your device. You can try opening your camera app separately to take a photo of your ID. When you have taken a photo, you can then start again and prove who you are by selecting ‘upload a photo’.

If this does not work, you can also try taking a photo on another device. For example, you can use another phone or tablet that belongs to you or a family member.

## How to give our website permission to access the camera and microphone

Your web browser should tell you any time a site requests access to your camera or microphone. This usually happens when you visit a website for the first time. You will be given the option to select ‘allow’ or ‘block’.

If you select ‘block’ the NHS login website will not be able to access your camera or microphone. You can change this by going to your web browser settings.

### Chrome

If you are using Google Chrome, select the icon to the left of the web page address in the address bar. This will allow you to view and change the permissions for the website you are on.

You can also go to Chrome’s settings and select the ‘privacy and security’ tab. Select ‘site settings’ to view and change permissions for your camera and microphone.

### Internet Explorer

If you are using Internet Explorer, go to the web browser’s settings page. Select ‘advanced settings’ and then ‘manage permissions’ to view and change permissions for your camera and microphone.

### Firefox

If you are using Firefox, you can select the website’s icon in your address bar and click ‘more information’.

Firefox also has a permissions manager that lets you see which permissions you have set up for different websites and change them all in one place. To access it, enter ‘about:permissions’ into your Firefox address bar.

### Safari

If you are using Safari, select ‘preferences’ to open the preferences window. You can then select the ‘security’ tab and ‘manage website settings’ to view and change permissions for your camera and microphone.

## What to do if your photo file is damaged

We run a virus check on the photo of your ID. If the file you upload is infected or damaged, you can try and upload another one.

If this keeps happening, there might be a problem with your device. Try taking a photo using a different device. For example, you can use another phone or tablet that belongs to you or a family member.

Send the photo to your usual device and try uploading it again. Or, you can upload your photo from the other device just to prove who you are. Once you have proven who you are, you can then use NHS login on your usual device as normal.

## How long does it take to check photo ID?

After you send your photo ID and video, your photo ID will be carefully checked and should be done within 2 hours. If you send between 9pm and 9am it may take longer. We will let you know by email whether the ID check has been successful.

---

## What happens if you do not pass the check?

If you do not pass the photo ID check, we will send you an email with some advice. We will tell you whether you should try again and what you can do to pass.

If you keep getting the same problem, you can prove who you are without photo ID instead.
