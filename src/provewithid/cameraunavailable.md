For some Android users, their gallery or file manager opens instead of their camera when trying to take a photo or record a video.

If your device’s default web browser does not have permission to access the camera, you will not be given the option to use it. Instead, your device's photo gallery or file manager app will open instead. You should allow permission for your web browser to access the camera and microphone to fix this.

If you still have problems you can try using a different device, like another phone or tablet. 

You can also prove who you are without using photo I.D. by using the registration details from your GP surgery’s online services.

If you do not know or remember your registration details, you can ask your GP to give you them.

The 3 details you need are:
* Linkage Key (could be called Passphrase)
* O.D.S. Code (could be called Organisation Code or Practice I.D.)
* Account I.D.

If you are not registered for your GP surgery’s online services, tell your GP surgery that you want to register, and they will ask you to fill in a form. Your surgery will then give you the 3 registration details.
