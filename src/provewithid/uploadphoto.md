When you choose the type of I.D. you want to use, you will be asked if you want to take a photo or upload an existing photo from your device. When you choose ‘upload a photo’ and select ‘choose a file’ on the next page, a window will open allowing you to choose and upload a file from your device.

Make sure:
* you have not covered any part of the page
* all 4 edges of the page are in your photo
* you can clearly see your face and all the text
* there's no shine from a light or window

## Uploading a photo on iOS devices

Some iOS users may have problems uploading their photo I.D. If the camera does not open or shows a black screen when taking a photo, this may be a problem with permissions or a known bug in the operating system.

Users should make sure the Safari browser on their device has camera and microphone permissions.

Updating the iOS operating system software on their device to a newer version may also help, if available. Version 11.2 will always show a black screen when trying to open the camera. There is an Apple support article that describes how to check for updates.
