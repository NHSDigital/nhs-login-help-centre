## There is already an account linked to my details

If you try to create an account and get a message that it already exists, it may be because there is already:

- an account with the email address you tried to use
- an account linked to the NHS number you entered, but with a different email address

You can try signing in with the email linked to this account.

If you cannot remember the email you used, check all your email accounts for an email from: noreply@login.nhs.uk.

    <span class="nhsuk-details__summary-text">
      You have already set up an NHS login
    </span>
  </summary>
  <div class="nhsuk-details__text">

    We have already used your details to connect you to the website or app you were trying to visit. This can happen if you already have an NHS login with a different email address.

  </summary>
  <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
