## There is already an account linked to my details

If you try to create an account and get a message that it already exists, it may be because there is already:

- an account with the email address you tried to use
- an account linked to the NHS number you entered, but with a different email address

You can try signing in with the email linked to this account.

If you cannot remember the email you used, check all your email accounts for an email from: noreply@login.nhs.uk.
