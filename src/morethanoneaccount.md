## There is already an NHS login account linked to the NHS number

An NHS login already exists with your NHS number but uses a different email address to the one you entered.

We cannot create this account as you can only have one NHS login connected to your NHS number.

## What you can do

Check all your in-boxes for emails from NHS login about logging in with the correct email address. The email you would have received is from: noreply@login.nhs.uk. For security reasons we are unable to disclose any information about an account.

## If you do not want the NHS login you previously created

1. [Sign into NHS login](https://settings.login.nhs.uk/ 'NHS login settings') using the email address and password you used to create the account.
2. Select 'Login Details' from the 'Manage my Account' page.
3. Select 'Delete my NHS account'.

This will only delete your online NHS account and will not affect your medical records.

## If you have forgotten your password

1. [Sign into NHS login](https://settings.login.nhs.uk/ 'NHS login settings') using the email address you used to create the account.
2. Select 'If you cannot remember your password, you can reset it'.
3. An email will be sent with a link to reset your password.
4. Enter and confirm your new password.

## If you want to change the email address you use to sign into NHS login

1. [Sign into NHS login](https://settings.login.nhs.uk/ 'NHS login settings') using the email address and password you used to create the account.
2. Select ‘Login details’ from the ‘Manage my Account’ page.
3. Select ‘Change email address’.
4. Enter your new email address.

We will send you a 6 digit security code to use to confirm your new email address.
