## What is NHS login?

NHS login lets you access a variety of digital health and care websites and apps with just one email address and password.

---

## What you need to set up an NHS login

You will need:

- an email address
- a UK mobile phone number

### What you need to do

A 6-digit security code will be sent to your email. You will be asked to enter this code to verify your email address and continue.

Next, you will be asked to give your mobile phone number. Another 6-digit security code will be sent by text message to your mobile phone. A security code will be sent to your mobile phone every time you log in, unless you select ‘remember this device and stop sending security codes’.

Right now, you cannot set up NHS login without a mobile phone. We are working on this and hope to offer a solution to users who do not own a mobile phone in the future.

### Additional information

To access some websites and apps, you may need to provide some additional information to prove who you are. This is so we can connect you to your NHS record and protect your health information.

This may include your:

- date of birth
- NHS number
- name
- postcode
