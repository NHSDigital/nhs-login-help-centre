## What you need to set up an NHS login

To set up an NHS login you will need:

- an email address (with more than 6 characters)
- a mobile phone or a landline number

To be able to use some services, you will also need to provide your:

- NHS number or your full name
- date of birth
- postcode

To access your health records or any personal information you will also need to provide high level proof of who you are. If your mobile phone number matches the one you have registered with your GP, we will use it to verify your identity. Otherwise, you will need to provide proof of identity.

This can be a:

- passport
- UK driving licence (full or provisional)
- Biometric Residence Permit (BRP)
- UK Residence Card, or EEA Biometric Residence Card (BRC) (including temporary pass)
- European driving licence (full)
- European national identity card

If you cannot provide a valid photo ID, you can use your registration details from your GP surgery.

These are:

- a Linkage Key (also known as Passphrase)
- an ODS Code (also known as Organisation Code or Surgery ID)
- an Account ID

You need to ask your GP surgery for these details.
