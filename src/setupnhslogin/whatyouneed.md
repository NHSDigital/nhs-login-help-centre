You will need:
 
* an email address
* a UK mobile phone number

## What you need to do

We will send you an email containing a link. Select this link to confirm your email address. Then return to the website or app you want to access and enter your NHS login email address and password. Here, you will be asked to give your mobile phone number.

A 6-digit security code will be sent by text message to your mobile phone. You will be asked to enter this code to continue. A security code will be needed to log in every time, unless you select ‘remember this device and stop sending security codes’.

There is currently no option to set up an NHS login if you do not own a mobile phone.

For some websites and apps, you may need to prove who you are to keep your information secure. Visit the [NHS login help centre home page](/nhs-help-centre/ "NHS login help centre home page") for more information on how to prove you are.
