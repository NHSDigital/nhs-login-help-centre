Click the NHS login button on the website or app you are visiting. Enter the email address and password to your NHS login. If you haven’t already created an NHS login you can do so first.

If you have selected the ‘remember my device’ feature previously, you will be logged in. If not, you will be sent a security code to your phone, which you must enter to log in.
