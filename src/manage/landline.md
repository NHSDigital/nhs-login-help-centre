## The link to cancel the update to your landline number does not work

To cancel the update to your landline number, you must select the confirmation link we send you. If the link does not work, there are a number of possible reasons why.

### Expired link – Reference CID3009

The link expires 24 hours after we email it to you.

We may have already updated the landline number you use to log in. In this case you would have received a confirmation email.

You can check or change your login and security settings in [your NHS account](https://settings.login.nhs.uk/ 'your NHS account').

[Contact us](/contact?error=CID3009 'Contact us') if you did not mean to change your landline number, or you do not have access to it.

### Used link – Reference CID3010

The link will not work if you have already used it and cancelled the update.

You can check or change your login and security settings in [your NHS account](https://settings.login.nhs.uk/ 'your NHS account').

[Contact us](/contact?error=CID3010 'Contact us') if you did not mean to change your landline number, or you do not have access to it.
