When you first set up an NHS login you are given the option to add a recovery email address. This is a second email address that you own, which will help to secure your NHS login. It will allow you to get back into your account if you cannot log in. We can also use your recovery email to contact you if there is suspicious activity on your NHS login.

If you did not add a recovery email address when you set up your NHS login, you can do so by visiting your NHS login settings. Scroll down to the heading ‘recovery methods’ and select ‘add email’. You can also remove or change an existing recovery email address.
