## How to manage your NHS login within websites and apps

You should be able to manage your NHS login settings from within the websites and apps that use NHS login. Each website and app you visit may offer a different way for you to access your [NHS login settings](https://settings.login.nhs.uk/ 'NHS login settings').

For example, in the NHS App you can change your NHS login email address, password and phone number by selecting ‘Settings’ and ‘NHS login’.

Contact the providers of the website or app you are using if you cannot find a way to access your NHS login settings.
