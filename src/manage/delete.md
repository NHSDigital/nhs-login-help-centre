## How to manage your NHS login in other websites and apps

Other websites or apps may offer you a different way to access your [NHS login settings](https://settings.login.nhs.uk/ 'NHS login settings').

For example, in the NHS App you can change your NHS login email address, password and phone number from **Manage NHS account** in **Account and settings**.

Contact the providers of the website or app you are using if you cannot find a way to access your NHS login settings.
