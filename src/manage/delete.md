## How to manage your NHS login within websites and apps

You should be able to manage your NHS login settings from within the websites and apps that use NHS login. Each website and app you visit may offer a different way for you to access your [NHS login settings](https://settings.login.nhs.uk/ 'NHS login settings').

Contact the providers of the website or app you are using if you cannot find a way to access your NHS login settings.

## Managing NHS login from the NHS App

At present there is no option to manage your NHS login settings within the NHS App. This is something we are currently working towards.

However, you can do this by selecting this link:

[https://settings.login.nhs.uk/](https://settings.login.nhs.uk/ 'NHS login settings').

For security reasons, you will need to log in with your usual NHS login details before you can change any of your details.

## How to delete NHS login

You can delete your NHS login by visiting your [NHS login settings](https://settings.login.nhs.uk/ 'NHS login settings').

Scroll down to the bottom and select ‘delete NHS login’. You will be asked to enter your password to confirm.

Once you delete your NHS login, you will not be able to use it to access any websites or apps. If you are trying to delete your account with just one website or app in particular, you should contact them directly. You may then still use your NHS login to access other websites and apps.

If you delete your NHS login, any websites or apps you have used with NHS login may keep some information about you in line with their terms and conditions and privacy notice. We may also keep some information about you in line with [NHS login's privacy notice](https://access.login.nhs.uk/privacy "NHS login's privacy notice")
