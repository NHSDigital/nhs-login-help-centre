## How to change your mobile phone number

You can change your phone number by visiting your [NHS login settings](https://settings.login.nhs.uk/ "NHS login settings"). Under the heading ‘your personal information’ select ‘change phone number’.

To visit your NHS login settings, you first need to log in with your NHS login details. To do this, you need access to your previous phone number that is currently on your NHS login.

## You have lost access to your mobile phone number

You can change the phone number on your NHS login by following the instruction on the screen where you would have entered the SMS code. You will need your NHS number to complete the process.

[Contact us](# "Contact us") if you cannot find your NHS number.

You will need to tell us:
* the email address for your NHS login
* the current phone number for your NHS login
* your new phone number

It will also help if you can tell us about a recent time when you have tried to log into a website or app using your NHS login. Tell us the date and time, if possible.

## The link to cancel changing your phone number does not work

To cancel changing your phone number on NHS login, you must select the confirmation link we send you. If the link does not work, there are a number of possible reasons why.

### Expired link – Reference CID3002

The link to cancel changing your phone number has a time limit of 24 hours. If it has been more than 24 hours since you received the link in your email, it will no longer work.

As it has been more than 24 hours, it may be too late to cancel as the phone number may have already been changed. You can check or change your phone number by visiting your NHS login settings.

[Contact us](# "Contact us") if you did not mean to change your phone number, or you do not have access to the phone number on your NHS login.

### Used link – Reference CID3003

The link to cancel changing your phone number may not work because you have already used it and have successfully cancelled changing your phone number. You can check or change your phone number by visiting your [NHS login settings](https://settings.login.nhs.uk/ "NHS login settings").
