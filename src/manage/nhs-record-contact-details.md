## Your NHS login details and NHS contact details

When you create an NHS login account, the [phone number](/manage/phonenumber 'phone number') and [email address](/manage/emailaddresses 'email address')
you use are only stored on this account. These are your NHS login details.
You use them to log in to your NHS account and other healthcare apps and websites.

Your NHS contact details are the details that your GP and other NHS services use to contact you.

## How to add or update your NHS contact details

You can add or update the NHS contact details on your NHS record by [logging into your NHS account](https://settings.login.nhs.uk 'logging into your NHS account') or by [using the NHS App](https://www.nhsapp.service.nhs.uk/login 'using the NHS App').

    <p>Some NHS services, like your GP surgery, may continue to use your previous contact details. This is because there may be a delay before they check your updated NHS record.</p>

We may send you a text or email if we find that any of the contact details on your NHS record are missing, or in an incorrect format.
