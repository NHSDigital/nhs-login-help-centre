## What is a passkey?

A passkey is a secure alternative to passwords. It is created and safely stored on your device.

Unlike passwords, which you need to remember and enter when you log in, you never have to type or enter your passkey.

You will be able to log in using your fingerprint, face, PIN, passcode, pattern or any other method you use to unlock your device.

## Why you should use a passkey

Passkeys provide the strongest protection against phishing and hacking attempts.

Each passkey is unique and linked to the website or app it is created for. Fraudulent apps or websites cannot steal your passkey.

Your passkey is safely stored on your device. No one can see or access it, including NHS login.

## What you need to set up a passkey

To set up a passkey you should have a screen lock on your device. A screen lock can be your fingerprint, face, passcode, PIN or pattern.

You also need to have Bluetooth enabled on your device. This will allow you to set up a passkey on a nearby device.
