To cancel changing your phone number on NHS login, you must follow the confirmation link we email you. If the link does not work, there are a number of possible reasons why.

## Expired link
The link to cancel changing your phone number has a time limit of 24 hours. If it has been more than 24 hours since you received the link in your email, it will no longer work.

As it has been more than 24 hours, it may be too late to cancel as the phone number may have already been changed. You can change your phone number again by visiting your NHS login settings page.

Call the National Service Desk if you did not mean to change your phone number, or you do not have access to the new phone number.

Phone: 0300 303 5035

Include the error reference code in your email or phone call: **CID3002**

## Used link
The link to cancel changing your phone number may not work because you have already used it and have successfully cancelled changing your phone number. You can check or change your phone number by visiting your NHS login settings page.

Call the National Service Desk if you do not have access to the phone number on your NHS login.
